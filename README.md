## Setup / Installation
**Start Development Server**
1. Clone the repo by running this command: `git clone https://github.com/PieroCobs/mpharma-product-manager.git`
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies <br/>(You'd have to have NodeJS installed on your machine to use npm. Head to [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) if not already installed)
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Open browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`

> The code for the development server is located at `/server.js`. The server runs on a port number defined as `CUSTOM_PORT` inside `/.env` â€” in this case, **3000**. This can change when being run in production.

**Create a static build**

To create a static build to be uploaded to a shared hosting server: 
1. Run `npm export`, which runs `next build` and `next export`.
2. Find the output of the previous command in `/out/`. This static build can be uploaded to the server.
